This is a wonderful app for keeping track of pgn-format games and databases for
a small chess club. It allows you to save, search and view pgn databases and games.
It includes a board.

Unfortunately, the download/upload function is, so far, purely copy and paste.

It is intended to work with google appengine, but feel free to use the files
in other contexts.

Minor bugs:

Make certain there are at least two tags at the top (that is usually the case:
'White' and 'Black' is already two); otherwise, it will only save every other
line.

Use latin characters (will fail with Russian characters).
