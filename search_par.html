		<p>
			This page is one level of searching. Type in a set of parameters below, in</br>
			the first field, and a set of values in the second field, separated by a</br>
			semicolon and a space. The third field is all of the games included in the search</br>
			so far; feel free to remove any by hand.</br></br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The way that this works is that, if ANY of the parameters have ANY of the values,</br>
			the game will be returned in the search</br>
			results. For instance, if you put</br></br>
			White; Black</br></br>
			into the first field, and</br></br>
			Dennis Bolshakov; Luke Stephens</br></br>
			into the second, the search will return all games where EITHER Dennis OR Luke</br>
			play EITHER White OR Black; in other words, all games games played by Luke or Dennis.</br>
			If, instead, you want all games with Dennis as White AND Luke as Black, search first for</br>
			"White" and "Dennis Bolshakov", then use the "search through remaining" option on</br>
			the search page and search for "Black" and "Luke Stephens."</br></br>
		</p>
		<p>
			For your convenience, given is a list of common attributes in games.</br></br>
			White, Black, Event, Site, Date, Round, Result, PlyCount,</br>
			EventDate, TimeControl, ECO, Annotator, Opening.</br></br>
			This is not a comprehensive list.</br></br>
